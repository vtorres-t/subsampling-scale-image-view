Subsampling Scale Image View (Kotatsu fork)
===========================

> A custom image view for Android, designed for photo galleries and displaying huge images (e.g. maps and building
> plans) without `OutOfMemoryError`s. Includes pinch to zoom, panning, rotation and animation support, and allows easy
> extension so you can add your own overlays and touch event detection.

# Differences from [upstream](https://github.com/davemorrissey/subsampling-scale-image-view)

- Fully rewritten in Kotlin and using Coroutines for image loading (using from Java code is supported as well)
- Loading images from zip files (`ImageSource.zipEntry`)
- Support for ColorFilter
- Automatically stores and restores state (zoom and center)
- Supports Interpolator for animation
- Handle mouse and keyboard/dpad events for scaling and panning
- Supports downsampling
